# Multuple_disease_ML_app
This repository contains a machine learning-based project for predicting multiple diseases based on various health parameters. The goal is to provide a diagnostic tool that can identify potential diseases from a single input dataset, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions.
#FEATURES
.1 Multi-Disease Prediction:-> Supports prediction for various diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson disease, using a single integrated model.
.2 User-Friendly Interface:-> Includes a simple interface for uploading health data and receiving predictions.
.3 Data Preprocessing:-> Automated data cleaning and feature engineering to optimize prediction accuracy.
.4 Multiple Algorithms:-> Implements various machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic Regression, SVM, ) for comparison.
.5 Model Evaluation:-> Detailed model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and visualization of results.

# Technologies Used :->
1. Python:-> Core programming language used for model development.
2. Machine Learning Libraries:-> Scikit-Learn for model building.
3. Data Visualization:-> Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizing data and results.
4. Streamlit (Optional):-> For building a simple web-based interface.

# Future Work :->
Expanding the number of diseases covered.
Integrating real-time data sources (e.g., wearable devices).
Deploying the model as a cloud-based service.
You can adjust the features and technologies section based on the actual implementation details of your project.
